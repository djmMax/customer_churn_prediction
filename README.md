# Customer Churn Prediction

When customers leave, this can be very costly for the company, thus firms are interested in predicting churn beforehand. Having that information in hand can help companies change their strategy to retain customers.

In this starter notebook, we'll walk through the competition. We will show you how to load the data and do a quick exploratory analysis. Then, we will train a simple model, make some predictions, and then submit those predictions to the competition.

The data we have describes 2.5 million [Expresso](https://www.expressotelecom.sn/) clients. Expresso is an African telecommunications services company that provides telecommunication services in five African markets: Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, and Ghana. Expresso offers a wide range of products and services to meet the needs of customers.

The objective of this work is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood for a customer to churn - to stop purchasing airtime and data from Expresso. Let's dig in!
